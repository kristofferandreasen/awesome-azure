# Awesome Azure - A Curated List of Azure Resources

This library provides resources to learn Azure and other Microsoft services. There is not one specific focus of the repository as Azure offers a large variety of services. The remaining files in the repo are Powershell files that allow you to perform actions on Azure. The main file azure-powershell.ps1 contains all the Powershell commands. In the Powershell-areas folder you will be able to find all the individual areas on Azure such as Machine Learning etc.

The repo starts with a few resources to get started with Azure in general. Then it moves onto all the resources in their respective areas. The resources includes both courses, videos, articles, guides etc. Every area has their own folder to make it easier to dive straight into the area you want to know more about. These folders similarly contains all the Powershell commands in the area. I have included a Powershell file with all the commands, which you can find here:

## Getting Started
Azure can be quite intimidating because of the vast amount of services and options.
Therefore it would make sense to choose a specific learning path in order to learn how Azure can be used within the area you work in.
I would recommend everone getting started with Azure to take the [Azure Fundamentals](https://openedx.microsoft.com/) course. This course provides a great introduction to all the various services. After this course you will have a better understanding of the Azure Ecosystem and you can dive into the specific area you are going to be working within.

## Developer Tools

* [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/) - Desktop client to easily manage Storage anywhere from Windows, MacOS, and Linux
* [Azure Resource Explorer](https://resources.azure.com/) - Allows you to view and edit Azure resource definitions directly from their JSON manfinests; effectively bypassing the API.

## Microsoft Azure Links
* [Microsoft Azure Homepage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) - Visit Microsoft's web page describing the services they provide in Azure.
* [Microsoft Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) - Create a free trial for 30 days. You will use your credit card for verification but you will not be charged for the products after the period ends.
* [Microsoft Azure Price Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/) - Microsoft created a pricing calculator to help you understand the pricing. Because the platform contains so many products, it is hard to understand the pricing.
This tool will make it easier to understand the pricing of the different products.
* [Microsoft Azure Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/) - The documentation features various areas depending on what you are looking for.
* [Azure Resource Manager Templates](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates) - This repo contains all the resource manager templates for Azure. It is very likely you can find the desired template here for your project.
* [Azure Tips And Tricks](http://azuredev.tips) is a resource that helps developers become more productive with Azure. Learn some of our favorite Azure tips and tricksâ€”some long-standing, and new ones that have recently been added to shave hours off your coding tasks tomorrow.

## Pricing

* [azureprice.net](http://azureprice.net/) - Find and compare Azure Virtual machines specs and pricing on a one page.
